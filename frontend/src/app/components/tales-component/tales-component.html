        <h1 class="ab-headline">The First Cheese Patch Shakes the Realm</h1>
        <h2 class="ab-byline">By Edith Breadcrumb, Senior Reporter</h2>
        <p>
          It was a morning like any other, until the world woke up to the fabled <b>Cheese Patch</b>. Over a single night, all coins had turned into glistening cheddar. Merchants panicked, warriors clashed for the last crumbs, and the Great Cheese Market Crash followed. “Never in my career have I seen so many barter with dairy,” says vault historian Sir Gouda, still sifting through mountains of pungent deposits. The Cheese Age ended as suddenly as it began, but some claim hidden cheese reserves fuel today’s black market.

          Survivors of this era still whisper about “cheese laundering rings” and the legendary artifact: <i>The Golden Fondue Fork</i>, said to melt any locked treasure. Skeptics doubt such relics exist, but then again, the cheese never really left, did it?

        <h1 class="ab-headline">Greg Sightings Surge: Vendor or Urban Legend?</h1>
        <h2 class="ab-byline">By Marley Snooper, Bazaar Correspondent</h2>
        <p>
          Reports are pouring in from across the server: Greg the Vendor, infamous for his “invisible lootboxes” and disappearing deals, was allegedly spotted twice in the past week. One witness claims to have bought “nothing at all” for 100 credits, only to receive a mysterious coupon reading “Thanks, Greg.” The Bazaar’s moderators urge caution: “If you see Greg, don’t blink. And whatever you do, never ask for a refund.” 
        </p>
        <p>
          Legends say Greg can appear on any Friday the 13th at precisely 3:33 AM server time, always behind a curtain of smoke and low-rez particle effects. Whether he is a glitch, an event, or just a bored admin remains unknown.

        <h1 class="ab-headline">Duck Uprising Baffles Experts</h1>
        <h2 class="ab-byline">By Winnie Quackford, Wildlife Editor</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>Duck Uprising</b> continues to confound strategists and players alike. What began as a harmless April patch rapidly evolved into chaos: monsters vanished, replaced by rubber ducks with cryptic battle moves and inexplicable resistance to damage. No guide could explain how to defeat the <i>Duck Overlord</i>, whose final attack—“Bubble Blast”—crashed a record 208 user sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emergency duck-ban measures were enacted, but the duck invasion lingers in the codebase. Rumors persist of hidden achievements for those who complete the “Quack Quest” in under 60 seconds.

        <h1 class="ab-headline">Exclusive: The AFK King Tells All</h1>
        <h2 class="ab-byline">By Roxy Idler, Features</h2>
        <p>
          <b>1,392 hours. Zero clicks. One legend.</b> In a Chronicle exclusive, we tracked down the elusive “AFKKing”—the only player to achieve Grandmaster status simply by staying logged in and walking away. “Honestly, I just had to go to class,” the King admits. “When I came back, there was a statue of me in the Hall of Legends and a note: ‘Congrats, you did nothing!’” As for future plans, the King says, “Maybe I’ll try moving the mouse next season.”

        <h2 class="ab-byline">By Patch Notes, Staff</h2>
        <p>
          Every veteran shudders at the phrase: Patch Tuesday. Last month’s infamous update swapped the “Attack” and “Pet Cat” buttons, sending an army of felines onto the battlefield. While cats offered no damage, they did boost morale (and allergies) across the server. Developers now test all future patches on their grandma’s laptop first.
