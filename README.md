# AutoBattler

**AutoBattler** is a hardcore, text-based autobattler RPG built for web. You control a single character in turn based combat against bots and other players. When your character dies, they’re gone for good, but your account, achievements, and cosmetic progress remain!

## What is AutoBattler?

AutoBattler blends classic RPG elements with a modern, text based interface. The focus is on tactical battles, meaningful choices, and a sense of risk and progression. No flashy graphics, just tense, strategy driven gameplay anywhere, on any device.

## Core Gameplay Features

- **Hardcore Permadeath:**  
  Each character can only die once. When you die, you start over with a new hero. Your account (user XP, cosmetics, and achievements) is always safe.

- **Text-Based Battles:**  
  Battles play out in stylized text. Each attack, defense, critical hit, and dodge is narrated in real time.

- **Turn-Based PvE & PvP:**  
  Fight AI enemies, raid dungeons, or challenge friends. Turns are resolved one action at a time, rewarding smart play.

- **Character Creation & Progression:**  
  Pick a class, choose your starting gear, and grow stronger by leveling up, unlocking new abilities, and finding loot.

- **Energy & Health Management:**  
  Daily limits on energy and health recovery force you to plan your battles and rest periods.

- **Equipment & Stats:**  
  Equip weapons, armor, and trinkets to boost your stats and unlock powerful synergies.

- **Dungeons & Raids:**  
  Tackle special encounters for rare rewards, some may be time limited or tied to in game events.

- **In-Game Currency & Cosmetics:**  
  Earn credits through play to buy gear, consumables, or customize your character with cosmetic items.

- **Social & Legacy Progression:**  
  Add friends, view top players, and browse the graveyard of fallen heroes. Earn account XP, titles, and badges that persist across all your characters.
